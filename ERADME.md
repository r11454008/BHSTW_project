## About me  
Hi, I'm Tsu-chun Yang (or you can call me Jim), from Taiwan hub, Postgraduate student at  National Taiwan University.

## Project goals
This project aims to use resting-state fMRI connectivity matrices to predict individual mood changes across multiple contexts.

### Main Objectives:
- To provide a full neuroimaging workflow from preprocessing of raw data to visualization of results.
- To utilize the resting state of individuals to predict their reactions in various situations involving interpersonal interactions.
- To establish a predict model by machine learning method.

### Personal Objectives:
- Understand the structure of raw data and BIDS files, and learn how to transform raw datas to BIDS files.
- Learn the expertise to visualize resting-state fMRI connectivity data.
- Practical use the machine learning methods taught in class to build a classification model.

### Abstract  
The aim of this project is to investigate whether resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data could be used to infer the mental state of subjects when faced with a competitive task with punishment. We manipulated win-lose conditions and punishments to induce different psychological states in participants, such as worry, envy, happiness, or luck. By using machine learning algorithms to identify specific patterns of brain activity associated with different mental states. This will allow us to develop a predictive model that can infer an individual's psychological state responses to different outcomes from their rs-fMRI data.
